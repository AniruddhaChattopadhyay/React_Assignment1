## React App to perform the task <br /> 
Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput <br /> <br />
UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs <br /> <br />
Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice) <br /> <br /> 
Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there <br />  <br />
Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component <br />  <br />
Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method) <br /> <br />
Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event <br /> <br />
Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput <br /> <br />
Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username <br /> <br />
Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets <br /> <br />
